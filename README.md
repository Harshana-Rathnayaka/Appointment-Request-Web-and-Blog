# Appointment Request Web and Blog

This is the first part of an Integrated Project which is a web application created using HTML and PHP. 

It allows the general user to send an appointment requestwhich is then stored in the Amazon Web Services cloud database.
These requests will be handled by the second part of this project which is the Desktop Application created using Java.

Also this web application has a blog site attached to it where the admin will be able to post various blog posts. But this blog is
not connected to the cloud database on Amazon. It is handled by a local MySQL database. 
So basically, this application is connected to two separate databases, one cloud and the other one in the local PC.
